About my website
It is a one page blog that contains 49 unique topics that fall into seven categories. If the user's input passes validation, each topic will store an array of headings, text, and an image in local storage and immediately display it to the user once submitted. There is no hardcoded data in this application.

I would have also had liked to:
1. Move the alert for the input type of "file" into imgUpload() Add Event Listener.
2. Populate the topics with data saved in local storage when the page is loaded.
3. Style the base pages (about, kitchens, baths, ...)
4. Fix the output area where local storage data is displayed.
